# 📊 Scientific Research Trends Analysis

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The growth of scientific publications mirrors the pace of global innovation, collaboration, and knowledge dissemination. Over the past few decades, open-access repositories like **arXiv** and platforms like **Semantic Scholar** have captured millions of research articles across disciplines.  

This project explores how research fields expand, how collaboration networks evolve, and how citation patterns reflect scientific influence. By analyzing large-scale research datasets, we aim to uncover **how science is being created, shared, and valued**.

## ✅ Completed Analysis

### 1️⃣ Research Growth Trends

**Question:**  
Which research areas (e.g., AI, medicine, renewable energy, climate science) show the fastest growth in publications, and are there bursts of activity following major breakthroughs?

**Findings:**  
- **AI and Medicine** exhibit the **fastest growth** in publications since 2015.  
- Noticeable **bursts of activity**:
  - *AI*: 2017–2018 (following deep learning breakthroughs).  
  - *Medicine*: 2020 (COVID-19 related research).  
- *Renewable energy* and *climate science* have demonstrated **steady linear growth** since 2010.  

**Visualization:**  
Publication trends across major disciplines.

### 3️⃣ Interdisciplinary Citation Advantage

**Question:**  
Are interdisciplinary papers (tagged with multiple fields) cited more frequently than single-discipline papers?

**Findings:**  
- Interdisciplinary papers receive **~1.4× more citations** on average than single-discipline papers.  
- Strongest cross-domain intersections:
  - *AI + Medicine* → medical imaging, drug discovery.  
  - *AI + Climate Science* → predictive modeling, sustainability.  
- This shows that **cross-domain collaboration enhances visibility and citation impact**.

**Visualization:**  
Average citation comparison between interdisciplinary and single-discipline papers.
